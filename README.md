Yatra2Chandigarh is a chatbot developed as a course project during the Plaksha Tech Leaders Fellowship 2023-24. It is designed to provide information and answer questions about the city of Chandigarh.

## Introduction

Whether you are a tourist exploring the "City Beautiful," a business traveler attending meetings and conferences, or someone considering moving to Chandigarh, Yatra2Chandigarh is here to assist you. Leveraging web-information (as of 11th Feb 2024) from the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation Limited (CITCO), this virtual guide offers insights into various aspects of Chandigarh, including tourist attractions, local cuisine, accommodation, transportation, and more.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pranoyghosh35/Yatra2Chandigarh.git
    cd Yatra2Chandigarh
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
Or build docker image and run it.

- docker build -t app .

### Web Scraping and Data Processing

We loaded web-scraped data available as several *.txt files kept inside the 'chandigarh_data' directory, tokenized them using CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.text_splitter, and embedded them into vectors using OpenAIEmbeddings. These vectors were then stored in Chroma database.

### Chroma Database

Chroma DB is an open-source vector storage system (vector database) designed for storing and retrieving vector embeddings. Its primary function is to store embeddings with associated metadata for subsequent use by extensive language models.

### Combining RAG, Langchain, and Vector Databases

We developed a retrieval-augmented AI system that is both generative and retrieval-based by combining the strength of OpenAIâ€™s GPT models, LangChain, and Chroma Vector Databases. This system can retrieve and use particular pieces of information in addition to producing creative and human-like text.

### Implementing Question Answering in LangChain

There are different ways to do question answering in LangChain. We used the ConversationalRetrievalChain, which offers a chat history component and is an advancement of RetriervalQAChat.

## Future Development Scope

- google gemini for those without openapi key.
- option to upload documents & images so that user can understand their bookings or understand more about the picture or tell about themselves for custmized itineraries!
